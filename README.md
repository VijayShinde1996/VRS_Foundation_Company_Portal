🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Company Portal with Employee Registration & Location Map! 🌍👨‍💻

I've been working on creating a professional and user-friendly Company Portal that includes:

✍️ Employee Registration Form
📋 Employee List
🧑‍💼 Employee Details Table
📍 Google Maps Integration to showcase the company location!
As part of this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure and enhance the portal's UI, ensuring it's both aesthetically pleasing and fully functional.

Check out the embedded map for Innomatics Research Labs directly on the portal, giving users an easy way to visualize the company’s location. 🗺️

Here’s a quick preview of what the portal offers: 1️⃣ Employee registration with all necessary details. 2️⃣ Seamless display of employee information. 3️⃣ Interactive map for enhanced user experience!

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in the code or want to collaborate on future projects. 🎯
